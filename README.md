This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine its moves.


Features

Minimax Algorithm: The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm, enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning, to make optimal moves.
Interactive Gameplay: You can play against the AI as the human player.
Simple Interface: The game is implemented in C++ with a console-based interface for ease of use.


How to Play

Setup: Compile and run the program.
